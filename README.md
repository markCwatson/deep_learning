# Deep Learning (Neural Networks)

## About
I have recently begun studying deep learning/neural networks. This is a collection of coursework from various deep learning courses I am taking. As of today (Dec 4, 2023), I am currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?). In 2024, I am considering going the [Artificial Intelligence Professional Program from Stanford School of Engineering](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program). Other than those, I am currently exploring other options. Let me know if you know of any good online/self-paced programs.
