# Deep Learning (Neural Networks)

## About
I have recently begun studying deep learning/neural networks. This is a collection of coursework from various deep learning courses I am taking. As of today (Dec 4, 2023), I am currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?).

I enrolled in the [Deep Learning course by Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science](https://execonline.cs.cmu.edu/deep-learning?utm_source=Google&utm_network=g&utm_medium=c&utm_term=cmu%20deep%20learning&utm_location=9000100&utm_campaign=B-365D_WW_GG_SE_CDL_Brand&utm_content=Deep_Learning&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPNZrFFn0mXa4NsyS7ZZXrDnWpR2fWPxhgCzrMgWorJ7pAHzRwSd9MRoCMy0QAvD_BwE). It starts on **February 8th, 2024**, and will run for 10 weeks. I will include coursework for this here too.

I am also considering doing the [Artificial Intelligence Professional Program from Stanford School of Engineering](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-professional-program). Other than those, I am currently exploring other options. Let me know if you know of any good online/self-paced programs.
