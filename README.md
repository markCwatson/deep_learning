# Deep Learning (Neural Networks)

## About
I have recently (Nov 2023) begun studying deep learning/neural networks. This is a collection of coursework from various deep learning courses I am taking. As of today (Dec 10, 2023), I am currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?).

## Kaggle
At the time of this writing (Dec 10, 2023), I am considering using [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) as both an additional learning resource and as a place to practice using real ML problems. I've created an account, and my progress can be viewed ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/markcwatson)).
