# Deep Learning (Neural Networks)

## About
I have recently (Nov 2023) begun studying deep learning/neural networks. This is a collection of coursework from various deep learning courses I am taking. As of today (Dec 10, 2023), I am currently doing the [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?).

I am currently enrolled in the [Deep Learning course by Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science](https://execonline.cs.cmu.edu/deep-learning?utm_source=Google&utm_network=g&utm_medium=c&utm_term=cmu%20deep%20learning&utm_location=9000100&utm_campaign=B-365D_WW_GG_SE_CDL_Brand&utm_content=Deep_Learning&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPNZrFFn0mXa4NsyS7ZZXrDnWpR2fWPxhgCzrMgWorJ7pAHzRwSd9MRoCMy0QAvD_BwE). It starts on **February 8th, 2024**, and it will run for 10 weeks. I will include coursework for this here too.

At the time of this writing (Dec 10, 2023), I am considering using [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) as both an additional learning resource and as a place to practice using real ML problems. I've created an account, and my progress can be viewed ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/markcwatson)).
