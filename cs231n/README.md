## CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
Beginning in 2015, CS231n was the first deep learning course offered at Stanford. It was developed by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) - who is a notable individual in the area of deep learning in both the commercial and educational space. Luckily we live in a time where top-tier educational content like this exists for free on the internet making it available to lowly common folk like me.

I am going to work through all of the course lectures (using [video recordings from 2016](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&si=DYrChFbwabUE0tr-) and official [lecture notes](https://cs231n.github.io/)), assignments, and the [final project](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/project.html) as if I was a real student taking this course, and I will put all of my coursework here in this repo.
